    ```

- Pull to local folder (fetch the latest version and merge with your project folder)

## Contributing

- If you make any changes to your project, you will need to make a Pull Request in order to add those changes to the main repo
 * NOTE: When you make changes, do not make changes to the scene directly or they will not integrate with the main project. Instead, store your changes in the form of "prefabs". To make a prefab, simply open the "Prefabs" folder under assets in the project window, and drag your game object into that folder. [Good video explaining prefabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plHcffZ0eLo)
 
- Add, commit, and push to your repo
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Put a message here that describes the changes you made. Do this often, smaller changes are better"
  git push origin main
  ```

- Then, go to your github repo's webpage, and close to the top, select where it says "Pull requests"
  * On the ensuing page, click the green button "New pull request"
  * You will have a list of comparisons you can choose from. Click the one that includes "LiamfosterLFF/main"
  * Give your pull request a title and some info about the changes you've made
  * Click "Create pull request" and you're good to go, I'll review it and add it into the main project shortly
